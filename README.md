# ECUre

**AI-Driven Vulnerability Scanner for Automotive ECUs**

ECUre is an intelligent security tool designed to scan and analyze vehicle **Electronic Control Units (ECUs)** for known vulnerabilities, anomalous behavior, and potential flaws. By combining **static and dynamic firmware analysis** with **machine learning techniques**, ECUre provides a scalable, automated approach to securing modern automotive systems.

---

## Key Features

* **Static & Dynamic Analysis**

  * Extract and analyze ECU firmware to identify security issues.
* **Comprehensive Vulnerability Database**

  * Built-in CVE references and automotive-specific threat intelligence.
* **Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning**

  * Identify abnormal patterns and behavior across ECUs.
* **Scalable Architecture**

  * Scan single or multiple ECUs simultaneously using Dockerized services.
* **Modern Web Dashboard**

  * Intuitive UI built with React/Vue.js for visualization and control.

---

## Target Users

* **Automotive Manufacturers** – integrate ECUre into the development lifecycle.
* **Security Researchers & Ethical Hackers** – investigate ECU firmware security.
* **Vehicle Owners & Consumers** – verify the integrity of vehicle electronics.
